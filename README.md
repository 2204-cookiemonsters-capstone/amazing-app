#HappiList
WELCOME TO OUR HAPPILIST

Happilist is a mobile social media app designed for both Android and iOS mobile devices. To use HappiList, users must sign up with an email address. 

From there, users can find and connect with friends, send and receive chat messages with their friends, create to-do lists, view and add to their friends' to-do list, and complete tasks. 

Each month, users have a list of 28 tasks to complete. These tasks are the same for all users, and are designed to promote happiness and wellbeing. To complete a task, a user must submit a short reflection about that task. Users can view their past achievements as well as their friends' public past achievements. Users can also view featured slides that include a link to a resource related to that task.
